                                    If an effect causes you to look at or reveal multiple cards in your library (for
                                    example, a creature with reconstitute died), finish looking at or revealing all the
                                    cards first, then teleport spells, then finish resolving the original effect.

                                    While looking at or revealing cards from your library, you must keep the cards in
                                    the same order until an effect lets you rearrange them. This order could matter if
                                    you tap Millikin for mana, for example, to pay the teleport cost.

                                    If an effect attempts to interact with a card that you teleported (for example, you
                                    teleported a creature card you were about to put into play from reconstitute), that
                                    part of the original effect fails and you continue resolving the rest of the effect.
                                    (In this example, no creature would be put into play with reconstitute)

                                    Murmur's first ability doesnât count as a creature entering the battlefield. Murmur

                                    If Murmur becomes a creature the same turn they enter the battlefield, they have

                                    Murmur's first ability causes them to become a creature with the creature type
                                    Assassin. They remain a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Murmur. (They also
                                    retain any other card types or subtypes they may have had.) Each subtype is
                                    correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature
                                    type), and Assassin is just a creature type (not a planeswalker type).

                                    If damage that canât be prevented is dealt to Murmur after their first ability has
                                    resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is
                                    marked on Murmur (since they're a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty
                                    counters to be removed from them (since they're a planeswalker). Even though they
                                    have indestructible, if Murmur has no loyalty counters on them, they're put into
                                    their ownerâs graveyard.

                                    You choose the modes as you cast the spell and pay the appropriate mana cost. You
                                    must choose up to X different modes, but no more than the modes printed on the card.
                                    Once modes are chosen, they canât be changed.

                                    You can choose a mode only if you can choose legal targets for that mode. Ignore the
                                    targeting requirements for modes that arenât chosen. For example, you can cast
                                    Ingolf's Command without targeting an enchantment provided you donât choose the

                                    they are printed on the card.

                                    If a Command is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to
                                    choose new targets for the copy, but you canât choose new modes.

                                    If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Command resolves, the
                                    spell wonât resolve and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is
                                    still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.

                                    The Martian Lens doesnât care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the
                                    mana they produce, such as Pillar of the Paruns and Hall of the Bandit Lord do. It
                                    just cares about types of mana.

                                    If you are somehow able to have multiple copies of The Martian Lens, they wonât help
                                    each other produce mana. If you control The Martian Lens, and all other lands you
                                    control either lack mana abilities or are other copies of The Martian Lens, you may
                                    still activate The Martian Lens's first ability â it just wonât produce any mana.
