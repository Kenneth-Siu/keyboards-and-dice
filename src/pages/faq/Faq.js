                                <b>Arm</b> is a <em>keyword action</em>. To "arm" a creature involves two steps:

                                There is no timing window where the equipment is on the battlefield and not attached to
                                the creature. It is created and then attached in the same action.
                            </li>

                                If the creature is not on the battlefield as you perform the arm action, the equipment
                                is created and then not attached to anything.

                                Some cards will instruct you that a creature enters the battlefield armed. This is a
                                static ability that creates a replacement effect: "If you would put this creature onto
                                the battlefield, instead put it onto the battlefield and arm it."
                            </li>

                                Some cards will instruct you to "arm target creature". If the creature is not on the
                                battlefield as the ability resolves, it will be countered by the game rules as normal
                                for having no legal targets, and therefore no equipment is created.

                                Teleport only works while you're looking at the card or revealing it while the card is
                                in the library. The effect needs to say "look" or "reveal" for this to work.

                                then you have to pay its teleport cost, which means you can activate mana abilities
                                while you're casting the spell while you're resolving the original spell or ability.

                                If you teleport a spell during the resolution of another spell or ability, you pick up

                                the original effect. Do not look at or reveal any additional cards to make up for the
                                teleported card.

                                spell on the stack. Any abilities that triggered when the spell was cast are put on the
                                stack now.

                                If an effect causes you to look at or reveal multiple cards in your library (for
                                example, a creature with Mutate died), finish looking at or revealing all the cards
                                first, then teleport spells, then finish resolving the original effect.

                                Millikin for mana, for example, to pay the teleport cost.

                                If an effect attempts to interact with a card that you teleported (for example, you
                                teleported a creature card you were about to put into play from Mutate), that part of
                                the original effect fails and you continue resolving the rest of the effect. (In this
                                example, no creature would be put into play with the Mutate ability)

                                Returning a creature you control to its ownerâs hand is part of the cost of Coordinate
                                Scramber's activated ability. Paying a cost canât be responded to (with Murder, for
                                example).

                                Since Coordinate Scrambler is a creature, you may return Coordinate Scrambler itself to
                                your hand. If you do, the rest of the ability will still work normally.

                                The creature card you put onto the battlefield when the ability resolves may be the same

                                battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence.
